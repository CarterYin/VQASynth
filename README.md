# VQASynth

*:construction: This repository is currently under construction.*

VQASynth is a library designed to synthesize datasets for training multimodal models. It includes example pipelines for constructing VQA datasets and training code for popular multimodal models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the test scripts, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.9 or later
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)

## Usage
Currently, the repository contains two test scripts to demonstrate the capabilities of the initial data processing pipelines:


ClipSeg-based SpatialVLM data processing (recommended):
```bash
cd tests/data_processing/
docker build -f clipseg_data_processing.dockerfile -t vqasynth:clipseg-dataproc-test .
docker run --gpus all -v /path/to/output/:/path/to/output vqasynth:clipseg-dataproc-test --input_image="warehouse_rgb.jpg" --output_dir "/path/to/output" 
```

GroundingDINO-based SpatialVLM data processing:
```bash
cd tests/data_processing/
docker build -f groundingDino_data_processing.dockerfile -t vqasynth:dino-dataproc-test .
docker run --gpus all -v /path/to/output/:/path/to/output vqasynth:dino-dataproc-test --input_image="warehouse_rgb.jpg" --output_dir "/path/to/output" 
```

The scripts will return assets like 3D point clouds, segmented images, labels, and prompt examples.
