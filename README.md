# VQASynth üéπ 

![GIF Description](./assets/vqasynth-example.gif)

**Spatial Reasoning** is fundamental to interacting within and navigating physical environments for embodied AI applications like robotics. However, data samples suitable for learning these capabilities are rare in AI pretraining datasets.
Don't be limited by what your model can do out-of-the-box, curate any image dataset from the Huggingface Hub for Spatial VQA with tools for 3D scene understanding. 

VLMs trained using VQASynth üéπ 
* estimate 3D distances between objects in an image
* describe distances colloquially, convert between common units of measurement
* answer queries about the orientation and spatial relationships between objects
* base responses on consistent references like floors and surfaces
* apply CoT "thinking" for more robust reasoning and better estimates

## Description

Fusing semantic and metric data into templated VQA chat, Vision Language Models can be instruction-tuned with low-rank adapters to enhance their baseline spatial reasoning capabilities. 
VQASynth üéπ provides an open-source reproduction of [SpatialVLM](https://spatial-vlm.github.io/), which describes a 3D scene reconstruction pipeline and prompt templates for enhancing the spatial reasoning abilities of VLMs including:

| Does the red forklift in warehouse appear on the left side of the brown cardboard boxes stacked? | How close is the man in red hat walking from the wooden pallet with boxes? | Does the man in blue shirt working have a greater height compared to the wooden pallet with boxes on floor? |
| <think>Okay, let me analyze the layout of the scene to figure this out. The red forklift is clearly visible and it's facing the stack of brown cardboard boxes. The boxes are loaded onto a pallet, and the forklift's forks are inserted under this pallet, indicating that the forklift is preparing to lift or place the boxes...To verify scale and orientation: the yellow safety rails and barriers are on the left side of the boxes. The ladder and wall panels are further left. The forklift is operating from the right-hand side of the image, engaging the pallet head-on...</think> <answer>Correct, the red forklift in the warehouse is not on the left side of the brown cardboard boxes stacked; it is on the right side, actively engaging the boxes from that direction.</answer> | <think>Alright, let me break this down. The man in the red hat is walking in a warehouse aisle, and there's a wooden pallet loaded with boxes right behind him. The pallet is attached to a manual pallet jack, which appears to have been pulled forward...Taking the average stride length of an adult male into account (about 0.75 meters or 75 cm), it looks like the distance from the man's heel to the nearest edge of the pallet is slightly shorter than a full stride. That puts us at just under that 75 cm mark. I'd estimate somewhere around 60 cm is reasonable here, based on visual proximity...</think> <answer>The man in the red hat walking is approximately 60.13 centimeters from the wooden pallet with boxes.</answer> | <think>Let me take a close look at this warehouse scene. The man in the blue shirt is leaning over, reaching toward boxes on a shelf, and there's a pallet with cardboard boxes on the floor near him. To compare their heights, I need to reason about how tall the man would be if he were standing straight, and how tall the pallet is with boxes stacked on top. A standard wooden pallet is about 15 cm (6 inches) tall. The boxes on top add some height, maybe around 30‚Äì50 cm depending on their size. Altogether, the total height of the loaded pallet might be roughly 45‚Äì65 cm (about 1.5 to 2 feet)...</think> <answer>Indeed, the man in the blue shirt working is taller compared to the wooden pallet with boxes on the floor.</answer> |

### Environment

Before running the demo scripts, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.10 or later
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), [Docker Compose V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/migrate/)
- [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)


## Run a Pipeline on Your Image Dataset

Use Docker Compose to transform Image datasets from Huggingface Hub into VQA datasets describing spatial relations between objects. 
You can process different datasets after updating the [config.yaml](config/config.yaml).

Then run the spatial VQA pipeline locally with Docker:

```bash
# Authenticate to push to hub
huggingface-cli login

# Run the pipeline
cd /path/to/VQASynth
bash run.sh
```
You can run the colab notebook using free-tier CPU or GPU acceleration or customize your own pipeline:
```python
from vqasynth.datasets import Dataloader
from vqasynth.embeddings import EmbeddingGenerator, TagFilter

dataloader = Dataloader(cache_dir)
dataset = dataloader.load_dataset(dataset_name)
embedding_generator = EmbeddingGenerator()
tag_filter = TagFilter()

include_tags = include_tags.strip().split(",")
exclude_tags = exclude_tags.strip().split(",")

# Extract embeddings
dataset = dataset.map(lambda example: embedding_generator.apply_transform(example, images))

# Extract tags
dataset = dataset.map(lambda example: tag_filter.apply_transform(example, include_tags + exclude_tags))

# Filter by tags
dataset_filtered = dataset.filter(
    lambda example: tag_filter.filter_by_tag(
        example['tag'], include_tags, exclude_tags
        )
    )
```

The resulting Huggingface dataset is in the cache directory and you can push to hub with:
```python
dataloader.push_to_hub(final_dataset, target_repo_name)
```
